Description: Package for assessment of variant callability in a given sequence alignment 
  with respect to i) loci of known somatic mutation hotspots in cancer , ii) loci for somatic 
  biomarkers in cancer, and iii) loci for pathogenic variants in hereditary cancers. Different levels 
  of callability (no coverage / low coverage / callable / high coverage), is determined 
  based on sequencing depth at the relevant loci in the given alignment, and where thresholds
  between levels can be configured by the user.
